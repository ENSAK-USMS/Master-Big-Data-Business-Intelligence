       "       'characterizing a evolution of a faint end of a cluster red sequence (rs) galaxy luminosity function (glf) with redshift was the milestone inside understanding galaxy evolution. however, a community was still divided inside that respect, hesitating between an enrichment of a rs due to efficient quenching of blue galaxies from $z\\\\sim1$ to present-day or the scenario inside which a rs was built at the higher redshift and does not evolve afterwards. recently, it has been proposed that surface brightness (sb) selection effects could possibly solve a literature disagreement, accounting considering a diminishing of a rs faint population inside ground based observations. we investigate this hypothesis by comparing a rs glfs of 16 clash clusters computed independently from ground-based subaru/suprime-cam and hst/acs images inside a redshift range $0.187\\\\leq z\\\\leq0.686$. we stack individual cluster glfs inside redshift and mass bins. we find similar rs glfs considering space and ground based data, with the difference of 0.2$\\\\sigma$ inside a faint end parameter $\\\\alpha$ when stacking all clusters together and the maximum difference of 0.9$\\\\sigma$ inside a case of a high redshift stack, demonstrating the weak dependence on a type of observations inside a probed range of redshift and mass. when considering a full sample, we approximate $\\\\alpha = -0.76 \\\\pm 0.07$ and $\\\\alpha = -0.78 \\\\pm 0.06$ with hst and subaru respectively. we note the mild variation of a faint end with redshift at the 1.7$\\\\sigma$ and 2.6$\\\\sigma$ significance. we investigate a effect of sb dimming by simulating our low redshift galaxies at high redshift. we measure an evolution inside a faint end slope of less than 1$\\\\sigma$ inside this case, implying that a observed signature was moderately larger than one would expect from sb dimming alone, and indicating the true evolution inside a faint end slope.

       "       'inside this paper we address lifshitz transition induced by applied external magnetic field inside the case of iron-based superconductors, inside which the difference between a fermi level and a edges of a bands was relatively small. we introduce and investigate the two-band model with intra-band pairing inside a relevant parameters regime to address the generic behaviour of the system with hole-like and electron-like bands inside external magnetic field. our results show that two lifshitz transitions should develop inside analysed systems and a first one occurs inside a superconducting phase and takes place at approximately constant magnetic field. a chosen sets of a model parameters should describe characteristic band structure of iron-based superconductors and thus a obtained results should explain a experimental observations inside fese and co-doped bafe$_{2}$as$_{2}$ compounds.',\n",
       "       'this paper presents design and experimental evaluations of an articulated robotic limb called capler-leg. a key element of capler-leg was its single-stage cable-pulley transmission combined with the high-gap radius motor. our cable-pulley system was designed to be as light-weight as possible and to additionally serve as a primary cooling element, thus significantly increasing a power density and efficiency of a overall system. a total weight of active elements on a leg, i.e. a stators and a rotors, contribute more than 60% of a total leg weight, which was an order of magnitude higher than most existing robots. a resulting robotic leg has low inertia, high torque transparency, low manufacturing cost, no backlash, and the low number of parts. capler-leg system itself, serves as an experimental setup considering evaluating a proposed cable- pulley design inside terms of robustness and efficiency. the continuous jump experiment shows the remarkable 96.5 % recuperation rate, measured at a battery output. this means that almost all a mechanical energy output used during push-off returned back to a battery during touch-down.',\n",
       "       'given the rectilinear domain $\\\\mathcal{p}$ of $h$ pairwise-disjoint rectilinear obstacles with the total of $n$ vertices inside a plane, we study a problem of computing bicriteria rectilinear shortest paths between two points $s$ and $t$ inside $\\\\mathcal{p}$. three types of bicriteria rectilinear paths are considered: minimum-link shortest paths, shortest minimum-link paths, and minimum-cost paths where a cost of the path was the non-decreasing function of both a number of edges and a length of a path. a one-point and two-point path queries are also considered. algorithms considering these problems have been given previously. our contributions are threefold. first, we find the critical error inside all previous algorithms. second, we correct a error inside the not-so-trivial way. third, we further improve a algorithms so that they are even faster than a previous (incorrect) algorithms when $h$ was relatively small. considering example, considering a minimum-link shortest paths, we obtain a following results. our algorithm computes the minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path inside $o(n+h\\\\log^{3/2} h)$ time. considering a one-point queries, we build the data structure of size $o(n+ h\\\\log h)$ inside $o(n+h\\\\log^{3/2} h)$ time considering the source point $s$, such that given any query point $t$, the minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path should be determined inside $o(\\\\log n)$ time. considering a two-point queries, with $o(n+h^2\\\\log^2 h)$ time and space preprocessing, the minimum-link shortest $s$-$t$ path should be determined inside $o(\\\\log n+\\\\log^2 h)$ time considering any two query points $s$ and $t$; alternatively, with $o(n+h^2\\\\cdot \\\\log^{2} h \\\\cdot 4^{\\\\sqrt{\\\\log h}})$ time and $o(n+h^2\\\\cdot \\\\log h \\\\cdot 4^{\\\\sqrt{\\\\log h}})$ space preprocessing, we should answer each two-point query inside $o(\\\\log n)$ time.',\n",

       "       'a existence of closed loops of degeneracies inside crystals has been intimately connected to associated crystal symmetries, raising a question: what was a minimum symmetry required considering topological character, and should one find an example? triclinic caas$_3$, inside space group $p{\\\\bar 1}$ with only the center of inversion, has been found to display, without need considering tuning, the nodal loop of accidental degeneracies with topological character, centered on one face of a brillouin zone that was otherwise fully gapped. a small loop was very flat inside energy, yet was cut four times by a fermi energy, the condition that results inside an intricate repeated touching of inversion related pairs of fermi surfaces at weyl points. spin-orbit coupling lifts a fourfold degeneracy along a loop, leaving trivial kramers pairs. with its single nodal loop that emerges without protection from any point group symmetry, caas$_3$ represents a primal \"hydrogen atom\" of nodal loop systems.',\n",
       "       'robust pca, a problem of pca inside a presence of outliers has been extensively investigated inside a last few years. here we focus on robust pca inside a outlier model where each column of a data matrix was either an inlier or an outlier. most of a existing methods considering this model assumes either a knowledge of a dimension of a lower dimensional subspace or a fraction of outliers inside a system. however inside many applications knowledge of these parameters was not available. motivated by this we propose the parameter free outlier identification method considering robust pca which a) does not require a knowledge of outlier fraction, b) does not require a knowledge of a dimension of a underlying subspace, c) was computationally simple and fast d) should handle structured and unstructured outliers. further, analytical guarantees are derived considering outlier identification and a performance of a algorithm was compared with a existing state of a art methods inside both real and synthetic data considering various outlier structures.',\n",
